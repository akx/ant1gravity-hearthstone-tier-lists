ant1gravity-hearthstone-tier-lists
==================================

Parses Ant1gravity's Hearthstone tier list spreadsheets into a more greppable form.

Credit where credit is due
--------------------------

Obviously the hard work has been done by Ant1gravity by publishing their arena draft tier lists over at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AifXEOqTcGcLdFVvWk1GRjVJTHJUaTVLcGViR1RRTFE (which is where the data in `input/` is from).

I just hacked together a little uninteresting script to parse it.
